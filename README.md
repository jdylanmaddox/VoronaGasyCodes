# VoronaGasyCodes
VoronaGasyCodes is a publicly accessible, actively curated database of mitochondrial barcodes for Malagasy birds. It was created to facilitate species identification for researchers in Madagascar using metabarcoding or traditional sampling methods. This initial database, introduced in our JOURNAL paper, includes sequence data from ??? vouchered museum specimens for six mitochondrial genes: 12S, 16S, COI, Cytb, ND2, and ND3. 

We produced these sequences using traditional Sanger sequencing methods with the following primers.

## How to use

## Future Plans
We plan to 
Consequently, we invite researchers working in Madagascar to submit their sequencing data for inclusion to the database. Please contact Dylan Maddox or Sushma Reddy to discuss potential submissions.
