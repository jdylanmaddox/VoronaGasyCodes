# VoronaGasyCodes
VoronaGasyCodes is a publicly accessible, actively curated database of mitochondrial barcodes for Malagasy birds. It was created to facilitate species identification for researchers in Madagascar using metabarcoding or traditional sampling methods. This initial database, introduced in our ADD_JOURNAL paper, includes sequence data from ??? vouchered museum specimens for six mitochondrial genes: 12S, 16S, COI, Cytb, ND2, and ND3. 

## How to use

## Future Plans
Our future objectives are to add missing endemic species and additional samples from multiple locations to calculate barcoding gaps. We to establish a comprehensive database backed by vourchered museum specimens. However, we recognize the utility of sequence data from other sources (eDNA, iDNA, etc.) and will consider incorporating it when it makes sense. To that end, we invite researchers working in Madagascar to submit their own data for inclusion to the database. For submission inquiries, please contact Dylan Maddox or Sushma Reddy.
